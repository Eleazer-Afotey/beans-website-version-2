                The story of Beans Inc began in a small house in the Richmond
                virginia where four friends, all passionate developers, came
                together with a shared vision to change the world through
                technology. Despite our differing backgrounds and skill sets,
                we bonded over our love for coding and our desire to create
                meaningful solutions that would improve people's lives. As we
                worked on various projects together, we discovered our their
                skills were complementary and that we were stronger as a team
                than as individuals. We quickly realized that they could
                achieve much more by combining our expertise and resources.
                And so, Beans Inc was born. At first, we focused on creating
                social communication platforms that would connect people in
                new and innovative ways. We saw the potential for technology
                to bring people together and break down barriers, and we were
                determined to make a positive impact in this area. Our first
                project was a hit, and we quickly gained a reputation as
                experts in the field of social communication. However, our
                ambitions extended beyond just social communication. We saw an
                opportunity to leverage our technical abilities to provide
                customized solutions to businesses in a variety of industries,
                including real estate. We knew that our combined expertise in
                both technology and real estate would allow us to provide
                unparalleled services to our clients. With each project we
                undertook, we grew closer, and Beans Inc grew in both size and
                reputation. Today, Beans Inc is a thriving conglomerate,
                providing technology solutions to businesses across the world.

      <h3>Eleazer Afotey</h3>
      <p>Software Engineer</p>
      <p class="p-5"> Eleazer Afotey is a Software Engineer who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the
        University of Richmond. Growing up in Ghana, Eleazer has always believed in the efficacy of Software in
        solving
        human problems. He’s worked with different technologies including Java, Python, javascript, and C++ and some
        of
        their respective frameworks. Eleazer has extensive experience building software solutions for firms and is
        currently working with Kinsale Insurance. Even as a developer, he has a keen interest in creative design and
        spends time designing the front end of software and applications he builds. Eventually, Ely plans on
        unearthing
        the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence to create more sophisticated solutions for
        strenuous problems.</p>

      <h3>Bernard Asare-Annan</h3>
      <p>Software Developer</p>
      <p class="p-5"> Bernard Asare-Annan is one of the four founding members of BEANs. He is a Bachelor’s and Associate's Degree
        holder in the field of Computer Science and has helped develop a vulnerability reporting and assessment system
        to be used by the Mecklenburg County of Richmond, Virginia, USA. During his early years moved back and forth
        often between Ghana and America and as he grew older and began to understand the world more he was disturbed
        by how the way of life was drastically different, especially on the basic scale of things. This ignited a
        flame in his heart to bring things up to par. IT is the path of the future and even though Africa might be a
        bit lacking in the financial and infrastructural aspects, he will do everything to make sure Africa does not
        fall behind in IT.</p>

      <h3>Nathaniel Danquah</h3>
      <p>Software Developer</p>
      <p class="p-5"> Nathaniel Adjei is a computer science major at VCU. With his experience working with several groups on school
        projects and other personal projects, he developed entrepreneur skills and the urge to provide amenities and
        services for his home Ghana. Nathaniel believes Ghana has the potential of being great and resourceful to
        other countries, this pushes him to make it an agenda to do his best as possible to change the narrative with
        his skills and knowledge in computers and technology. As a computer scientist, he believes the future is
        already here. Hence, Africa being able to have its technological resources and not solely depend on the other
        part of the world is a must. This encourages him to join heads with these great talents to come up with an
        entity like BEANs.</p>
